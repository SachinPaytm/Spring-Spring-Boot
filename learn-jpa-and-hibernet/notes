in JDBC we need to write sql queries in String format and then we execute those queries
whereas in JPA we have entityManager which provides these queries like for inersetion by merge,
for finding by find and for deletion by find & remove
while in Spring data JPA code becomes more easy like we have save() for updatation queries,
deleteById for deletion, and findByName,findBy.. methods.
